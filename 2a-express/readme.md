## What is NPM

- NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages (otherwise known as modules).
- The NPM program is installed on your computer when you installed Node.js

## How to install Express using NPM

Before taking any action, it's important to be in the _**root directory**_ of your application via the terminal. That means you should see **FINAL.js**, **START.js**, and **index.js** if you use the `ls` command in the terminal. From now on, we will use **index.js** instead of **PROG.js** because this is standard for a Node application. This is similar to the way **index.html** is the standard for the default web page name.

One way we can ensure we're in the right place is to use VS Code to open an integrated terminal where the file is. You can pull up a menu on that particular file in VS Code's file explorer and choose "Open In Integrated Terminal". You have to do what's typically called a "secondary click" on the file to pull up this menu. This is typically done in one of three ways:

- holding the control key as you click
- clicking with the right button on a mouse or trackpad with multiple buttons
- tapping with two fingers spaced about a half inch apart 

Doing one of these secondary clicks on a file ought to pull up a menu, and on that menu should be "Open In Integrated Terminal". Choosing that option will always open the terminal in the correct location for the file you clicked.

Once you are in the correct place in the terminal, use the following command to initialize a node project:

0. A) In terminal, initialize the project

```
npm init -y
```

When this is done for the first time, a **package.json** should appear. Open the file. There should be a property that says `"main": "index.js",`. If it says `"main": "final.js",` instead, edit this file to say `"main": "index.js",`. Most things in a **package.json** file should never be edited, but for the sake of learning about Node applications correctly, these small details must be aligned correctly.

Once this is prepared, use the following command to install the Express module:

0. B) In terminal, install the express module

```
npm install express
```

A new file called **package-lock.json** should appear. A folder called **node_modules** should also appear, which holds the currently installed version of Express.

## What is a package.json

The **package.json** file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package. It is generated once you install Node modules. Dependencies are just modules that are REQUIRED for your application to function; your application DEPENDS on the modules.

The **package-lock.json** is created for locking the dependency with the installed version. It will install the exact version of that package in your application and save it in **package.json**

## What is the Express Module

Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes)
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request-processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline

It's time to begin building out our first server file!

Import the Express module, and prepare a variable that immediately invokes the Express function:

1. Import the express module, and prepare a ready-to-use variable for it

```js
const express = require("express"); // Import the module
const app = express(); // Ready-to-use variable
```

Let's set up the port on our local machine that we want to use:

2. Set the Port we want to use

```js
const PORT = 3000; // 3000 and 8080 are commonly used ports for development
```

Now it's time to make sure the server can start up, and listen to requests:

3. Set the application to begin listening / begin spinning the server

```js
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Now run `node index.js` in your terminal to find out if your server is working so far. You should see "server is listening on port 3000" in your terminal, which means the server can actively listen to requests! Press `ctrl + c` to stop the server.

Next, we will be setting up how to respond to requests at `localhost:3000/` and similar URLs, starting with the base URL:

4. Set up a response to localhost:3000/

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log("user hit the resource");
  res.status(200).send("Home Page"); // send the client the text "Home Page" with a success status
});
```

Every time we set up a new response:

- Use the command `node index.js` in the terminal to run the server.
- Use your browser to test the response.
- Shut the server down using `ctrl + c`

If we go to `localhost:3000/` in the browser, you'll see "user hit the resource" in your terminal. That tells us that someone made a request! You should also see the words "Home Page" in your browser. If you notice, we're also setting a `status(200)` to the response.

## What is a status code

A status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled. Here is a list of status codes, with their meanings:

- `200` - successful request
- `304` - repeated successful request with no changes (ie. refreshed the page)
- `404` - requested resource cannot be found
- `401` - authentication error, attempt to access a protected resource
- `500` - generic error, when no other error is suitable

Next, we will set up a response to `localhost:3000/about` to make sure we can access more than one page:

5. Set up a response to localhost:3000/about

```js
app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("About Page"); // send the client the text "About Page" with a success status
});
```

Finally, it's time to set up for ALL OTHER URL extensions, and return a `404` status code, because there are no other resources to access:

6. Set up a response to localhost:3000/\*

```js
// * means all, any page that isn't listed so far. So if you reach localhost:3000/* this should be the response
app.all("*", (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send("<h1>page not found</h1>"); // send the client "page not found" with a not found status
});
```

An asterisk `*` is commonly used to represent "anything" when it comes to setting up responses to URLs. Make sure to try and visit various URL extensions once the server is up and running.

## What is an API

API is an acronym that stands for "Application Programming Interface", which is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. A server can host an API. When you create a server that responds to various requests with different forms of data, this is called an API! (This can mean serving HTML vs serving JSON, or it can mean serving all text but the contents of each text is different).

By completing this lesson, you have created an API.
